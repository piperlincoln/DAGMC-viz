=======================

The Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo visualization toolkit requires Python 2.7, VisIt, and MOAB. The inclusion of VisIt and MOAB in the PYTHONPATH and the VisIt executable in the PATH is required. A user can input a geometry file and a data file to produce default interactive output in VisIt, with the option to save images of the plot windows as well. Functionality allowing the user to have full control of determining the output will be implemented in the future.

----------------------------------------

1. DataLoading.py can be used to create a default output in VisIt from an h5m geometry file and an h5m or vtk data file. The following four interactive plot windows are displayed in a 2x2 grid.

      1. A cube with a clip through the first octant.
      2. XY plane slice through the centroid.
      3. XZ plane slice through the centroid.
      4. ZY plane slice through the centroid.
      
Each window has a mesh plot with the "STL_mesh" variable, a Pseudocolor plot with the "TALLY_TAG" variable, and the second, third, and fourth windows have Contour plots with the "ERROR_TAG" variable. 

```
python DataLoading.py [geometry_file] [data_file] 
```
The user may indicate whether or not they would like each window to be saved as a png file in their current directory by adding the ```-i``` option to the command.

```
python DataLoading.py [geometry_file] [data_file] -i 
```
The user may indicate whether or not they would like the VisIt session file to be saved in their current directory by adding the ```-s``` option to the command.

```
python DataLoading.py [geometry_file] [data_file] -s 
```

A sample output from an h5m geometry file and a vtk data file can be seen below.

----------------------------------------

2. GraveIdentifyAndRemove.py can be used to remove the graveyard volume/group from an h5m geometry file. The new file will be written in the current directory with ```_no_grave.h5m``` appended onto the original file name. It can also extract curve, surface, and volume EntitySets.

```
python GraveIdentifyAndRemove.py [h5m file] 
```

The user may specify a specific output file name and extension by adding the ```-o``` option to the command. The new file will be written in the current directory.
 
```
python GraveIdentifyAndRemove.py [h5m file] -o [output file] 
```

----------------------------------------

3. TagExpansion.py can be used to expand vector tags on a mesh and generate a data file for each value in the vector tag. VisIt will recognize the collection of these data files as a database, and permit stepping through them in an animation.

```
python TagExpansion.py [meshfile]
```
